not minimal, doesnt say 3

the sum will be the same? no


n7 not minimal, why



reqruiement says increase, but not how much


complete? -> satisfy all the requirements
minimality? -> satisfy only the requiremnt, dont add anyhing
can we do that exercise again


state-based system -> system which are working perfectly and some situations (example toronto 13%, and alberta 5%)

stck -> lifo
queu -> fifo

correctness: correct/partially correct/ none


1- you can not say if it is correct without having all the inputs


correct -> everything is correct (all the inputs)
partially correct -> doesnt have all inputs

totally wrong -> has at least one input wrong


Chapter 6:

Failure, erorr and fault
.failure - not happening between, just the final result
.error -> causes failure or might not causes a failure
.fault => might causes an erorr or not




fault -> error -> failure
       |
	-> no error -> no error



fault sensitized -> error
fault not sensiteed -> no error



error masked -> no failure
error propagated error -> yes failure
error -> about the input
fault -> about the code


fault an evasive concept
